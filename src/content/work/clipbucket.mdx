## About

ClipBucket is a free and open source software which helps us to create a complete video sharing website like YouTube, Dailymotion, Metacafe, Veoh, Hulu in few minutes of setup. It was first created in 2007 by Arslan Hassan and his team of developers. ClipBucket was developed as a YouTube clone but has been upgraded with advanced features and enhancements. It uses FFMPEG for video conversion and thumbs generation which is the most widely used application so, users can stream it straight away using the Video JS and HTML 5 Players.
