## About

Commbus was formed in 1999 by its directors who, having worked together on several individual projects decided to combine their expertise together to provide a high quality professional service with individual solutions designed exactly to our clients specifications.

The Directors experience came from a wide variety of industry fields such as public address, lighting for stage and concerts, television, outdoor events, marketing and vehicle management.
