## About

An Ecovend reverse vending machine or RVM is a recycling device with integrated technology that accepts used (empty) beverage containers in return for a monetary or non-monetary reward â€“ these can be for example vouchers, discounts or even charitable donations.

Our machines provide an automated function that collects, sorts, compacts and stores bottles and cans. This provides a simple and effective solution to beverage container waste.
